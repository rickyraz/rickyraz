# Ricky Raihan Azhari

**Infrastructure Engineer** transitioning from telecom automation to payment systems.

## About

Currently building production automation for fiber networks (60K+ devices) while 
exploring payment infrastructure through hands-on projects. Focused on the hard 
technical problems: multi-currency settlement, exact decimal arithmetic, legacy 
system integration, and high-throughput transaction processing.

**Transition focus:** Applying distributed systems and infrastructure engineering 
experience from telecom to payment systems challenges.

## Payment Infrastructure Projects

### 🌏 [corridor](https://github.com/rickyraz/corridor)
**Multi-currency payment platform** | *Active development*

Cross-border payment infrastructure with real-time FX integration, settlement 
reconciliation, and double-entry accounting. Built for remittance corridors but 
architecture supports any multi-currency payment scenario.

**Tech:** Go · PostgreSQL · Redis · TigerBeetle  
**Capabilities:** Multi-currency accounts, FX engine, settlement reconciliation, 
audit trails

<!--   ### 🔧 [spectrum](https://github.com/rickyraz/spectrum) -->
### 🔧 spectrum
**Payment rails abstraction** | *Active development*

Unified interface across payment methods—bank transfers (SWIFT/ACH/SEPA), 
mobile money, card networks, CBDC. Provides corridor with provider-agnostic 
payment execution.

**Tech:** Go · Zig (FFI layer for performance-critical paths)  
**Design:** Abstract provider differences, consistent API for payment applications

<!-- ### 🔨 [zcobol](https://github.com/rickyraz/zcobol)  -->
### 🔨 zcobol
**Financial primitives for Zig** | *Research*

COBOL-compatible data types for modern systems. COMP-3 packed decimals, 
EBCDIC codec, mainframe file I/O. Enables processing legacy bank data formats 
with exact precision.

**Tech:** Zig  
**Use case:** Settlement file processing, batch reconciliation, mainframe integration  
**Context:** 43% of banking systems globally still run COBOL

<!-- [Volt](https://github.com/rickyraz/volt) 
<!-- ### ⚡ volt - message broker [Planned]
Persistent queue in Zig for payment event streaming. Designed for 
mainframe-to-cloud integration patterns.

Status: Architecture research | Start: 2028
Tech: Zig, RocksDB
  -->
## Professional Experience

**Software Engineer** | Network Automation & Infrastructure  
*2022 - Present*

Production automation for fiber network operations (60K+ ONUs, 310+ OLT devices). 
Built provisioning systems, monitoring dashboards, incident ticketing platform.

**Tech:** TypeScript · EffectTS · Go · Redis · PostgreSQL  
**Systems:** ONU activation automation, network monitoring, API integration with 
network equipment

**Previously:** Backend development (Node.js/TypeScript), database optimization, 
distributed caching

**Transferable skills:**
- High-availability systems (99.9% uptime telecom infrastructure)
- Real-time data processing (network telemetry, event streams)
- API integration with legacy systems (OLT vendor APIs)
- CRUD systems and automation tooling

## Technical Experience

### Professional (Proven in Production)
**Languages:** TypeScript · Go · SQL  
**Infrastructure:** PostgreSQL · Redis  
**Domains:** Distributed systems · Real-time processing · API integration · 
Network automation

### Exploring (Side Projects)
**Payment domains:** Settlement · Multi-currency ledgers · FX integration · 
Legacy bank interop  
**Tech stack:** Temporal · TigerBeetle · Zig  
**Protocols:** GPON/ITU-T (professional) · SWIFT/ISO 20022 (learning)

## What I'm Looking For

**Transition goal:** Infrastructure or backend engineering roles in payment systems, 
where my distributed systems experience and payment exploration can converge.

**Ideal opportunities:**

**Early-stage fintech** where I can:
- Build payment infrastructure from ground up
- Contribute to core settlement systems
- Work on legacy bank integration challenges

**Engineering roles in:**
- Cross-border payment platforms
- Payment processors (settlement, reconciliation)
- Core banking modernization
- Real-time payment rails

**What I bring:**
- Production infrastructure experience (high-availability, scale)
- Self-directed payment systems learning (corridor, spectrum, zcobol)
- Hands-on fintech exploration (not just theory)
- Comfortable with ambiguity and greenfield projects

**Locations:** Singapore · Remote (EU/US) · Open to relocation  
**Timezone:** Flexible for global teams (UTC+7, adaptable)
